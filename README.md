# Triangle type interview test

This is React + TypeScript app that identifies the type of a triangle based on the size of sides.

The goal of the test is to:

- Complete the empty `getTypeOfTriangle` helper function based on the types below
- Write the accompanying unit tests for the function
- Use the function to display the type of the inputted triangle from the form

## Types of triangle

- **Equilateral**: All 3 sides are the same size
- **Isosceles**: 2 of the sides are the same size
- **Scalene**: None of the sides are the same size
